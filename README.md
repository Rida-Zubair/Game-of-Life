# Game-of-Life
Conway's Game of Life: Watch simple patterns of live cells evolve into complex structures based on birth and death rules, simulating a captivating world of cellular automata.
Explore the fascinating world of cellular automata with this C++ implementation of Conway's Game of Life. Watch simple patterns evolve into complex structures based on a few fundamental rules.

Key Features:
User-friendly interface for choosing random or user-defined initial configurations.
Efficient cell state updates using secondary and neighbor arrays.
Clear visualization of the grid's state at each iteration.
Ability to run the simulation for a specified number of generations.
Detection of stable or empty/full grid states.

Installation:
This code is written in C++ and can be compiled using any standard C++ compiler.

Usage:
Clone this repository using git clone https://github.com/Rida-Zubair/Game-of-Life.git.
Navigate to the project directory: cd game-of-life.
Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler (e.g., g++ game_of_life.cpp -o game_of_life).
Run the executable: ./game_of_life

Gameplay:
Choose between random cell initialization or manually defining live cells.
If entering live cells, provide coordinates (format to be specified in code).
Enter the desired number of simulation iterations.

Output:
The grid state will be printed after initialization and at each iteration.
Information about the final grid state (stable, empty, or full) will be displayed.
Coordinates of live cells in the final grid will be provided.
